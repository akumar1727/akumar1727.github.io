* I am a Ph.D student in the [Departement of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.unm.edu) at [University of New Mexico](http://www.unm.edu), since January 2019, as a member of the PROTON lab with [Prof. E.E.Tsiropoulou](http://www.ece.unm.edu/faculty-staff/electrical-and-computer/eirini-eleni-tsiropoulou.html) as an advisor. 
* My major field of research lies in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep representation learning and reinforcement learning, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, natural language understanding and multi-agent systems.
* I received my Master’s Degree in the [Departement of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), in October 2018.
