* I am a Ph.D student in the [Departement of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.unm.edu) at [University of New Mexico, USA](http://www.unm.edu), since January 2019, as a member of the PROTON lab with [Prof. E.E.Tsiropoulou](http://www.ece.unm.edu/faculty-staff/electrical-and-computer/eirini-eleni-tsiropoulou.html) as an advisor. 
* My major field of research is Computer Systems and Networks, which lies in the general area of game theory and machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning and neural networks, as well as their applications in public safety, distributed decision making and resource orchestration in interdependent systems.
* I received my Diploma(5-years studies) from the [Departement of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en), [National Technical University of Athens, Greece](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), in October 2018.
